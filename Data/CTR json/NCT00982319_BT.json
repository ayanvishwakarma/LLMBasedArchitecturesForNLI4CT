Quality control of these stains is performed regularly in the immunohistochemistry laboratory (using lymphoid tissue for Ki67). Initial notation is performed where possible on a minimum of 3000 cells, counting the number of positive cells divided by the total number of cells. The lesions of SICD will be noted separately in adjacent normal tissues. The justification for choosing Ki67 as a measure of cell proliferation includes the robustness of the coloration reaction, correlation with the S-phase fraction of the cell cycle and the mitotic index and it can be determined successfully from central breast biopsies provided that there is an adequate yield of epithelial cells. A negative value reflects a decrease in the positive cells of ki67, thus a decrease in cell proliferation.", "Time limit: change from reference period to 14 days after intervention", "Results 1:", "Title of arm/group: Broccoli spray extract and mango juice", "Description of the arm/group: Patients will be randomized to 14 days of broccoli germ extract intervention consisting of a constant dose of sulfaphane dissolved in mango juice.
