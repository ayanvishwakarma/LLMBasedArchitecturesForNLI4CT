A patient is considered to be a 6-month progression-free survivor if the patient is at 6 months of registration without a disease progression document (it is not necessary for the patient to be in study at 6 months to be considered a success). The proportion of success will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of patients assessed. Confidence intervals for the proportion of actual success will be calculated using the properties of the binomial distribution. The progression is defined using the RECIST criteria, as an increase of at least 20% in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of the target lesions taking as a reference the smallest sum of LD recorded since the start of treatment or the occurrence of one or more new lesions, the occurrence of one or more new lesions, or the unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.", "Time limit: 6 months", "Results 1:", "Title of the arm/group : Paclitaxel + Gemcitabine + Bevacizumab", "In the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, patients receive 125 mg/m^2 paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30 minutes and 1000 mg/m^2 gemcitabine IV hydrochloride over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and 15 mg/kg bevacizumab IV over 30 to 90 minutes on day 1.", "Total number of participants analysed: 48", "Type of measurement: Number", "Unit of measure: proportion of patients without progression 0.792 (0.647 to 0.882)"], "Adverse Events": ["Undesirable Events 1:", "Total: 20/49 (48.82 per cent)", "Febrile neutropenia 1/49 (2.04%)", "Haemoglobin decrease 3/49 (6.12%)", "Constipation 1/49 (2.04%)", "Diarrhoea 3/49 (6.12 per cent)", "Oral mucositis 1/49 (2.04%)", "Nausea 3/49 (6.12 per cent)", "Fistula of the oral cavity 1/49 (2.04%)", "Vomiting 2/49 (4.08%)", "Fatigue 3/49 (6.12 per cent)", "Fever 2/49 (4.08%)", "- Catheter-related infection 1/49 (2.04%)", "Infection 1/49 (2.04%)"]}
