The statistician will provide graphical representations of each reader's ROC curve for each test condition. For each reader, the difference between the CSA for the FFDM read in conjunction with the FFDM plus the DBT will be presented. The statistician will perform a CSA MRMC comparison between the FFDM read in conjunction with the FFDM and the DBT using the Dorfman, Berbaum & Metz MRMC method (1992).", "Time limit: 1 month", "Results 1:", "Title of the arm/group: FFDM Plus DBT", "Description of the arm/group: Breast images with FFDM and DBT", "FFDM Plus DBT: Fujifilm Aspira Crystal System", "Total number of participants analysed: 100", "Average (standard error)", "Unit of measurement: Probability 100 (0.812)", "Results 2:", "Title of arm/group: FFDM", "Description of the arm/group: Breast images with FFDM alone", "FFDM: Fujifilm Aspira Crystal System", "Total number of participants analysed: 100", "Average (standard error)", "Unit of measurement: Probability 100 (0.780)"], "Adverse Events": ["Undesirable Events 1:", "Total: 0/100 (0.00 %)", "Adverse Events 2:", "Total: 0/100 (0.00 %)"]}
