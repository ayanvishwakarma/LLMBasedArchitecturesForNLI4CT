Subjects receive a list of words and are asked to repeat as many words as they can remember on three occasions. There are no low and high absolute values, as the scores are age-adjusted.Reported scores are T-scores-average scores should be 50, with a standard deviation of 10, any score below 50 indicates a performance below the population averages and any score above 50 indicates a performance above the population averages.The COWA test is a verbal fluence test that measures the spontaneous production of words in the same category or starting with a designed letter. Z scores are converted to z-score scores. A -1 score is a standard deviation below the average. The lowest and highest Z scores can be -3.0 and 3.0.
