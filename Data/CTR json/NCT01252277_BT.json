Women who do not menstruate regularly due to the use of certain types of contraceptives may be subject to restrictions. Their progesterone estrogen and stimulating follicular hormone (FSH) levels must be documented at the random basis of fine peri-areolar needle aspiration (PRFNA) and their out-of-study RPFNA must occur at a similar part of their cycle (high or low progesterone rate). To do so, a serum progesterone must be obtained ~ 4 weeks prior to the planned RPFNA and 2 weeks later so that the RPFNA can be performed in the same phase of the \"cycle\" as the database.", "Subjects should be at increased risk of breast cancer on the basis of at least one of the following criteria:", "A five-year gail risk of 1.67% or three times the average risk for a woman of the same age using either the Epidemiology Surveillance and Final Results database (SEER, http://seer.cancer.gov) or the NCI breast cancer risk assessment tool (www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool) or a 10-year risk of Tyrer-Cuzick twice the population risk indicated in the model, or the ANPRF Atypie", "BMI < 40 Kg/m3", "A first-degree parent with breast cancer under the age of 60 or several second-degree parents with breast cancer.", "Several previous biopsies or at least one anterior biopsy with atypical hyperplasia (AH), lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), in situ channel carcinoma (CDIS).", "Signs of ANPR hyperplasia with atypia in the last three years;", "\u2022 Radiation of the chest or neck before the age of 30;", "The mammographic density by visual estimation is equal to or greater than 50%.", "Subjects should be willing to maintain the same hormonal medium present for inclusion throughout the trial.

Women with DSIS should have had appropriate local therapy (lumpectomy plus radiation or mastectomy). If the subject has had DSIS, at least two months should be spent on surgery and/or radiotherapy in the breast concerned. Only contralateral (milk not involved) will be studied by the RPFNA. The subject may not have had contralateral breast radiotherapy to be studied.", "\u2022 Those over 40 years of age must have undergone screening mammography within 6 months of entry into the interventional part of the study and must be considered as non-suspect breast cancer or, if suspected, have completed all the suggested tests, including biopsy, and have no evidence of cancer.", "The subjects must have had a breast AFRP within six months of entry into the intervention part of the study and be prepared to have another AFRP at ~6.5 months after the onset of LovazaTM.", "Subjects should have cytomorphological evidence of hyperplasia with atypia or atypia borderline (masood score 14 or more).
